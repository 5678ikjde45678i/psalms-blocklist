psalm's Pi-Hole Ad &amp; Tracker Blocklist

In today's digital age, online tracking and advertising can be overwhelming. With so many trackers and advertisers vying for our attention, it's easy to feel like we're losing control over our own online identity.

That's why I'm excited to share this list of ad and tracker blockers that you can easily integrate into your Pi Hole configuration. These tools are designed to help you manage your online activity, protect your personal data, and take back some control over your digital life.

By using these blockers, you'll be able to:

- Reduce distractions and minimize the number of ads you see on the internet
- Protect your online privacy and security
- Enjoy a more streamlined and focused browsing experience

This list is my way of contributing to the ongoing conversation about online safety and responsibility. I believe that by taking small steps like this, we can all make a positive impact on our digital lives.

So, if you're looking for ways to simplify your online experience and protect yourself from unwanted tracking and advertising, I hope you find this list helpful."
